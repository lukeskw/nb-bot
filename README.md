# Welcome!

This is my first **Twitter Bot**. It's based on the Firebase Functions service.

# What does it do?

This bot is a set of 2 functions: 
>The first tweets from time to time based on a cron schedule;
>The second checks if there's something on the user timeline and replies to the last tweet.


And that's about it!!!
